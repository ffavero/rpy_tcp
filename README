If you need to generate images, graphs, or perform a  statistical 
analysis, in a Web application, R-cran is a very helpful resource.

In order to do so there are few options, most of them require to run R 
directly on the Web-server (Rapache for instance, or Rpy on 
CGI/mod_perl).
Most system Admin are not happy about that, because R might have some 
bad influence on the server performance, degrading the performance of 
all the server, and all the consequential implications.

A solution can be reached by the implementation of a small socket 
server, written in python and using the Rpy library to execute R 
functions passed from a proper client script.

basic usage:

#Server Start:
python rpyserver.py 9999

#Client
python rpyclient.py localhost:9999 'pdf(file="plot1.pdf")/plot(x=c(1:10),y=c(1:10))/dev.off()'
